# Micro Frontend Starter

This repository is made with a minimal structure to illustrate a micro frontend application architecture.

**Webpack** is used as the bundler and **Webpack Module Federation** plugin is used to link the micro frontends with the container app. In the app directory, `cart` and `products` are the micro frontend's and `container` used to consume those micro-frontend's.
